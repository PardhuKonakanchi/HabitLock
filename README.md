# HabitLock

Great people follow great habits in their day to day life to ensure the best possibility of future success. I believe that people don't rise to the expectations of what they could do because they fall to the environment they put themselves in. This means that in order to build habits and routines that benefit us while avoiding habits that can be self-damaging, we need to change the environment itself to rise to this expectation. In our day and age, technology is a highly productive tool but more often than not it simply serves as a distraction (even as I'm working on this project every now and then :)). My hope is to be able to streamline habit building information and practices into one app so people can more easily reach the goals they set for themselves by created the proper digital environment. I want it to be an app I can use daily to ensure I'm following the habits I set for myself, and I hope others follow along so that they can implement the behaviours they would like to unlock their potential.
